          The soul owner, creator, and developer of this website is Nishant Yadav.
          I created this Learning Management System (LMS) website to help local
          schools work efficiently and manage their data online. I have worked on both
          the front-end and back-end of this website to ensure it serves the needs of
          students, teachers, and administrators effectively.
